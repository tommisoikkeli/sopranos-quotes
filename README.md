# sopranos-quotes

## What is this?

Application dedicated to one of my personal favorite TV shows of all time. Built with Vue and Spring Boot. Backend code can be found [here](https://github.com/tommisoikkeli/sopranos-quotes-api).

No images are used in the app to avoid any copyright issues. Instead, wikipedia link is provided for each character for more details.

The app is live [here](https://sopranos-quotes.surge.sh/#/).

The backend is running on Heroku on a free dyno so the initial response may take some time as the server wakes up.

## Running locally

Install dependencies with `npm install`.
Start the app with `npm run serve`.
